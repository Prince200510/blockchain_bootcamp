# Simple Escrow Move Smart Contract

## Description
This project implements a simple escrow smart contract using the Move language for the Aptos blockchain. The contract allows a sender to lock funds for a receiver and later release those funds securely, ensuring trustless transactions between parties.

## Vision
To provide a secure, transparent, and easy-to-use escrow mechanism for peer-to-peer transactions on the Aptos blockchain, reducing the risk of fraud and building trust in decentralized exchanges.

## Future Scope
- Add dispute resolution mechanisms for more complex escrow scenarios
- Support for multiple token types and custom assets
- Integration with decentralized identity and reputation systems
- User-friendly front-end for non-technical users
